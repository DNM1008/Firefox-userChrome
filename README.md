# Firefox-userChrome
**My Firefox appearance config files:**

* The folder "img" contains the image that I want to set as my background in my home page. This is so that I have an image directory right in my userChrome profile folder.

* In "userContent.css", I set the background picture to the image, in my folder it's "Ambitious but rubbish.jpg".
  * If the window is narrower than 1080px, it chances the background to "Jinx.jpg"

* In "userChrome.css", I hide the tool bar above altogether, you can still access it using F6 (I recommend switching to other shortcuts).

* I tried to bring back the old looks, as I found it to be much more aesthetically pleasing than Proton.



**Below should be how your home page looks like**
* When the address bar is focused: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54259825/130071482-db7c70c5-f1a4-43b7-94c5-17a7f8233bac.png)
* When the address bar is unfocused: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54259825/130071569-1111bf22-012c-4964-85f5-132356099fb9.png)
