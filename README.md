# Firefox-userChrome
My Firefox appearance config files

The folder "img" contains the image that I want to set as my background in my home page. This is so that I have an image directory right in my userChrome profile folder

In "userContent.css", I set the background picture to the image, in my folder it's "Ambitious but rubbish.jpg". 

In "userChrome.css", I disable the url bar enlargement and set the max height of the toolbox to 28px, then enable scroll so that the address bar can still be accessed if needed.
I found these codes and modified them a while ago, so if you wrote the code and want me to mention you, don't hesitate to contact me
