# Firefox-userChrome
**My Firefox appearance config files:**

* The folder "img" contains the image that I want to set as my background in my home page. This is so that I have an image directory right in my userChrome profile folder.

* In "userContent.css", I set the background picture to the image depending on the width of the monitor, in my folder it's "Catppuccin.jpg" in the main monitor, in the vertical monitor, it's "Warrior.jpg".

* In "userChrome.css", I adapted the pop out menus to the catppuccin theme, I also add more padding to make them "nicer".
* I tried to bring back the old looks, as I found it to be much more aesthetically pleasing than Proton.
* Put [Khue Doan's userChrome.css](https://github.com/khuedoan/one-line-firefox/blob/master/userChrome.css) in the chrome folder



**Below should be how your home page looks like**
* If your monitor is wider than 1080px: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54259825/197147348-b9852d84-08b7-482a-9bee-a052bbb2e543.png)
* If it's vertical (less than 1080px wide): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54259825/197147567-77cda598-28ae-47d7-9c22-58f143b9f1f0.png)
