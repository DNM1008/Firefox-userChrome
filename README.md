# Firefox-userChrome
My Firefox appearance config files

The folder "img" contains the image that I want to set as my background in my home page. This is so that I have an image directory right in my userChrome profile folder

In "userContent.css", I set the background picture to the image, in my folder it's "Ambitious but rubbish.jpg". 

In "userChrome.css", I hide the tool bar above altogether, you can still access it using F6 (I recommend switching to other shortcuts)

I tried to bring back the old looks, as I found it to be much more aesthetically pleasing than Proton

## Almost all of the code was either found online or was my edition of code I found online, if you want me to credit you, please get in touch. If you want to use what I have here for any reason, feel free to do so
