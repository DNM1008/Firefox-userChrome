# Firefox-userChrome
**My Firefox appearance config files:**

* The folder "img" contains the image that I want to set as my background in my home page. This is so that I have an image directory right in my userChrome profile folder.

* In "userContent.css", I set the background picture to the image, in my folder it's "Ghostblade.jpg".
  * If the window is narrower than 1080px, it chances the background to "Jinx.jpg"

* In "userChrome.css", I hide the tool bar above altogether, you can still access it using F6 (I recommend switching to other shortcuts).

* I tried to bring back the old looks, as I found it to be much more aesthetically pleasing than Proton.



**Below should be how your home page looks like**
* When the address bar is focused: ![focused](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54259825/182157335-1113959c-be97-4fb0-8211-42a795e0f4fd.jpg)
* When the address bar is unfocused: ![unfocused](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54259825/182157366-4a5205b6-a11d-4d1a-805c-ad10bd6df8ad.jpg)
