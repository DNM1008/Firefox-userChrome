# Firefox-userChrome
My Firefox appearance config files

The folder "img" contains the image that I want to set as my background in my home page. This is so that I have an image directory right in my userChrome profile folder

In "userContent.css", I set the background picture to the image, in my folder it's "Ambitious but rubbish.jpg". 

In "userChrome.css", I disable the url bar enlargement and set that the navigation toolbox (including the tab bar and the url box) so that it hides most of itself when the cursor is elsewhere, but leave behind the area that's 10 pixel tall the hover the cursor should there's a need to. When the cursor is hovering over that area, the navigation toolbox fills in and the transparency is disabled.
 
 - The annimation took 0.5s
 - After the cursor leaves the top area for 5 seconds, the navigation toolbox hides itself again

I found these codes a while ago, so if you wrote the code and want me to mention you, don't hesitate to contact me
